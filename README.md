\***\*Backend Learning Sandbox (Multi-App Backend Learning Project)\*\***

A personal backend engineering sandbox for building multiple real-world applications inside a single Node.js + TypeScript codebase.

**_🚀 Overview_**

This project started as a small practice environment to learn and implement authentication in Node.js, but it quickly evolved into something bigger.

I realized that to truly grow as a backend engineer, I needed to build multiple types of applications, explore different architectural patterns, work with several databases, and handle real-world backend problems.

So this repository is now a multi-application backend playground, containing different backend applications such as:

1. 📝 Blog App
2. 🛒 E-commerce App
3. 💬 Chat App
4. 🧠 Quiz App
5. 🗒️ Notes App
6. 🏥 Health-Care App

More apps coming as I explore new concepts…

This project is designed as a continuous learning journey — not a finished product.
Anyone is welcome to explore the code, open issues, submit PRs, or simply give feedback.
I’m building this to become a better backend developer, and feedback is always appreciated.

**_🎯 Goals of This Project_**

-Gain deep backend development skills using Node.js + TypeScript
-Learn authentication & authorization (JWT, sessions, access/refresh tokens)
-Practice multi-module backend architecture in one codebase
-Explore multiple databases (MongoDB first, PostgreSQL later)
-Learn proper API design, error handling, and clean code practices

Work with real-world backend patterns such as:
-Controllers & Services
-Middleware pipelines
-Reusable utilities
-Config-driven environments
-Route modularization

Build production-ready backend components that can scale across apps

**_🏗️ Technologies Used_**
Core Stack:

-Node.js
-Express.js v5
-TypeScript
-MongoDB (Mongoose)
-PostgreSQL (coming soon)
